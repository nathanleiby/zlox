- [ ] `value.zig`: Refactor the Value union to use more elegant code (see Zig docs for unions.. they can infer type, have methods on struct)
- [ ] `compiler.zig`: Refactor binary operations
- [ ] Ensure `main.zig` is capable of reading files. It seems like the REPL works but not file execution.
- [ ] (someday) code profiling / speed
    - could profile some of the open-source impls too, for comparison
